**FinVision AI** bridges the gap between raw financial data and actionable insights by leveraging Artificial Intelligence to:```



- ✅ Analyze spending patternsOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- ✅ Provide budgeting recommendations

- ✅ Predict future expensesYou can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- ✅ Offer personalized financial insights

- ✅ Help users achieve their savings goalsThis project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

- ✅ Reduce unnecessary expenses

- ✅ Improve long-term financial stability## Learn More



## 🎯 Problem StatementTo learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:



Individuals struggle with personal finance management due to the lack of:- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

- Real-time insights- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

- Predictive analysis

- Personalized suggestionsYou can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!



Existing tools only track income and expenses at a basic level without analyzing behavior or providing meaningful recommendations. There's a critical need for an AI-powered system that tracks transactions, analyzes patterns, predicts trends, and delivers customized financial advice.## Deploy on Vercel



## ✨ Key FeaturesThe easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
